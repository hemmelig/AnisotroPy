Introduction to the `anisotropy.materials.Material` class
=========================================================
In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of the `~anisotropy.materials.Material` class. This class performs the task of representing an arbitrarily (an)isotropic elastic material and provides methods for computing a number of elastic moduli e.g. the bulk and shear moduli, group and phase velocities, and performing arbitrary rotations.

As detailed in the general background on materials and elasticity, a linearly elastic material can be defined completely by an elastic stiffness tensor, :math:`C_{ijkl}` (a 4th-rank tensor), and a density, :math:`\rho`. In practice, these are often measured in the lab and reported in publications, though it is possible to derive theoretical single-crystal values. **FIND A GOOD LEAPING OFF POINT FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN THIS**

A material can also be provided with an assortment of metadata, including: a material symmetry (to be implemented), a material ID, and a reference + DOI (Digital Object Identifier; to be implemented) if the values are derived from literature.

Creating a new `Material`
-------------------------
To create a new `Material` object, you need to provide a stiffness tensor in the reduced Voigt form and a density. Here is an example for creating a `Material` object representing single-crystal olivine:

::

    from anisotropy.materials import Material

    # Moduli and density are from Abramson et al., 1997
    C = [[320.5,  68.1,  71.6,  0.0,  0.0,  0.0],
         [ 68.1, 196.5,  76.8,  0.0,  0.0,  0.0],
         [ 71.6,  76.8, 233.5,  0.0,  0.0,  0.0],
         [  0.0,   0.0,   0.0, 64.0,  0.0,  0.0],
         [  0.0,   0.0,   0.0,  0.0, 77.0,  0.0],
         [  0.0,   0.0,   0.0,  0.0,  0.0, 78.7]]
    rho = 3.355

    material = Material(C, rho)
    print(material)

We now have an object whose various elastic properties we can query. The `print` call returns a neat summary of the material.

Loading an existing `Material`
------------------------------
There is a large body of work dedicated to the experimental determination of the elastic moduli of minerals (single-crystals) and rocks (aggregates). `AnisotroPy` provides a database of published material descriptions that can be simply loaded:

::

    from anisotropy.materials import load

    material = load("olivine")
    print(material)

As above, the `print` call returns a neat summary of the material. We can compare two materials by simply using the `==` operator

::

    from anisotropy.materials import load, Material

    C = [[320.5,  68.1,  71.6,  0.0,  0.0,  0.0],
         [ 68.1, 196.5,  76.8,  0.0,  0.0,  0.0],
         [ 71.6,  76.8, 233.5,  0.0,  0.0,  0.0],
         [  0.0,   0.0,   0.0, 64.0,  0.0,  0.0],
         [  0.0,   0.0,   0.0,  0.0, 77.0,  0.0],
         [  0.0,   0.0,   0.0,  0.0,  0.0, 78.7]]
    rho = 3.355

    material1 = Material(C, rho)
    material2 = load("olivine")

    print(material1 == material2)

Exploring the elastic properties of a `Material`
------------------------------------------------
Phase velocities
################
For example, we can calculate the seismic phase speeds for a plane wave propagating along the the crystallographic "a" ([100]), "b" ([010]), and "c" ([001]) axes:

::

    from anisotropy.materials import load

    material = load("olivine")

    # Calculate phase speeds in olivine for a plane wave propagating along:
    # the "a" ([100]) axis
    a_vp, a_vs1, a_vs2, *_ = material.phase_speeds(0, 0)

    # the "b" ([010]) axis
    b_vp, b_vs1, b_vs2, *_ = material.phase_speeds(0, 90)

    # the "c" ([001]) axis
    c_vp, c_vs1, c_vs2, *_ = material.phase_speeds(90, 0)

    print("The phase speeds (in km/s) for a plane wave propagating along the a/b/c axes:")
    print(f" Vp: a - {a_vp:5.3f}; b - {b_vp:5.3f}; c - {c_vp:5.3f}")
    print(f"Vs1: a - {a_vs1:5.3f}; b - {b_vs1:5.3f}; c - {c_vs1:5.3f}")
    print(f"Vs2: a - {a_vs2:5.3f}; b - {b_vs2:5.3f}; c - {c_vs2:5.3f}")

Bulk and shear moduli
#####################
The bulk and shear moduli of an isotropic material are measures of how resistant that material is to compression and shearing, respectively.

The bulk modulus, often denoted as K or B, is defined as the ratio of the infinitesimal pressure increase to the resulting relative decrease of the volume. This property appears in the isotropic equation for the P-wave velocity.

The shear modulus, often denoted as G, S, or Î¼, is defined as the ratio of shear stress to the shear strain. This property appears in the isotropic equations for both the P- and S-wave velocities.

Summary
-------
In the next tutorial, we will cover how to build materials that represent aggregates of multiple constitutive materials, for example for the mantle.
